Maximizing Revenue: Predicting Uncertain Demand and Optimizing Purchases for Buyers

As part of my contribution to the backend development of our capstone project, we streamlined procurement through a data-driven approach. In our project company's customized manufacturing framework, we addressed the challenges of managing demand variations using sophisticated procurement strategies, leveraging stochastic optimization techniques.

Historically, our project company encountered operational hurdles such as inventory shortages and prolonged lead times due to demand uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we implemented a stochastic model incorporating Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and Monte Carlo simulations across two stages, ensuring precise procurement decisions amidst uncertainties.

Our primary goal was to empower buyers with a user-friendly tool for optimal order suggestions, supplier preferences, and product quantities. Transitioning from traditional deterministic approaches to a stochastic model, we considered the inherent variability in demand.

While the deterministic procurement model minimized costs, it overlooked demand fluctuations, leading to suboptimal inventory levels. In contrast, our stochastic model adapted to real-time demand variations, ensuring efficient procurement decisions.

By integrating a dynamic search function into our model, users could effortlessly access product-specific demand forecasts derived from years of historical data. Utilizing time series analysis and machine learning algorithms, we accurately forecasted demand for upcoming months.

Our ensemble of time series models, including MProphet and Baseline methods, forecasted demand while considering various demand patterns. Each model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), ensuring the selection of the most accurate model for each product.

Furthermore, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for demand forecasts, providing a reliable range for potential demand. These forecasts, along with Monte Carlo sampling, guided optimal purchasing strategies, offering clear suggestions on order quantities and supplier options.

In essence, our data-driven approach, a part of my backend coding contribution to our capstone project, revolutionized the procurement process, enabling proactive decision-making and efficient inventory management in the face of demand uncertainties.
